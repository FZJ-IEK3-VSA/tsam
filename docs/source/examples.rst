.. note::

   Additional notebooks for hyperparameter tuning are available in the
   `examples/ <https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam/tree/master/examples>`_ directory:

   - ``aggregation_segment_period_opti.ipynb`` - Full hyperparameter optimization
   - ``aggregation_segment_period_building_timeseries.ipynb`` - Building supply optimization
   - ``aggregation_segment_period_animation.ipynb`` - Animated visualizations

   These are excluded from docs builds due to long execution times.
